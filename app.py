            My name is Jan Marfy S. Baccay but everyone calls me Marfy. I am a grade 10 student from Canlubang
            Christian School, learning the skills of coding. I have created this page in order to enhance my 
            skills in coding, as part of my education, and most importantly is to present my mother's small cake 
            business to the world. I hope for everyone to support her and for those who already did, thank you
            and may you continue to do so.
            
            My mother's name is Mary Jane Baccay, a loving wife and a caring mother to two children. She started
            her small business at the end of the covid pandemic. Life was truly tough during those times and her
            business was very helpful for the family. She started by herself, teaching herself through online 
            methods. She was very hardworking, taking good care of the family while perfecting her craft, she does 
            not just bake but she also sews beautiful and good quality clothes, bedsheets, curtains, and many more.
            A very talented individual indeed.   
            
            If this sounds interesting to you, consider liking her page and contacting her for more information. 
            Thankyou and God bless"""
